                    The park's highest point rises near Martew Lake, a modest summit of 106 meters that offers views across this tapestry of forest and water. Below, peat bogs stretch like emerald carpets, dotted with sundews and orchids that paint the landscape with delicate colors. The air carries the scent of pine needles and damp earth, a perfume that speaks of wilderness untouched by time.
                    <br /><br />Here, nature writes its own story â€“ one of ancient forests, winding rivers, and creatures living in harmony with land shaped over millennia. Each season brings its own chapter: spring's awakening chorus, summer's verdant canopy, autumn's golden glow, and winter's silent blanket of snow. Drawa National Park stands as a testament to nature's enduring beauty, where every moment holds a story waiting to be discovered.
